# Object-Detection-in-a-video
Project done by: Anik Paul( IITB, MSc. ASI, 22N0070)
Here for the project the idea of Cimputer vision is used and 'opencv' module is used.
Steps are:
1. Used the Gaussian Blur,rotated,found edges and coloured the edges in a live video feed
2. Detected face and eyes in a live video 
3. used flann based matcher to detect the similaritys in 2 photos
4. Detected Football in a video
5. In first frame we capture the background and after if we introduce a red object to the frame we will change that pixels to the background pixels
6. By using the contours we will detect the shape like circle,triangle,quadrilateral,pentagon and hexagon.
